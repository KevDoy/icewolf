# Icewolf
The open-source web browser

---
## What is this?
Icewolf is a browser built using Electron, and Electron is based on Chromium, soooooooooo I guess this is a chromium browser?

## How do I install this?
This program is currently in beta, so the GitHub release isn't that obvious, but what you need to do is go to the "Releases" section and download the latest version.

### Note:
This program doesn't automatically update, however when that version comes out, you won't need to come here every single time for an update.

## Current Features
These are features that have been added to Icewolf.
- **Browsing the web (obviously)**
- Searching from the New Tab page.
- Bookmarks
- Tabs
- Borderless window
